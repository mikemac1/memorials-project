# memorials-project
This project is about allowing people to build memory pages of their loved ones.

## Problem Domain

28 October - Building a site for everyone to access that has lost a loved one and give them the ability to share their loved one's remembrance page.

## Comments & Reflections  - 28 October

* **How did this go, overall:** 
Good start to have something commence as I begin this site on Katie's 30th birthday. 

* **What observations or questions do I need to answer or find answers for which I need the site to progress?**
 To get Rachel's buy-in is important as the genesis for this site and what it is to become is really due to her.  A couple of thoughts I need to begin brainstorming are:
 
 - How to produce random QRcodes and ensure they are maintained?
 - Where to host the site once we are out of testing and how the hosting can be paid for?
 - Where to allow Rachel to post her ideas in way that is easy for her so we can collaborate seemlessly?
