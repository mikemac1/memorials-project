# memorials-project
This project is about allowing people to build memory pages of their loved ones.  It will allow them to have a QR code people can scan and it would take them to a browser or the app and it would be an in-app memorial. Loved ones could scroll photos and videos of the person, see a small family tree, a playlist would be playing upon opening. A link to a charity the person loved could be included. People that scan it and visit can leave virtual flowers to let them know someone was there.

## Problem Domain

28 October - Building a site for everyone to access that has lost a loved one and give them the ability to share their loved one's remembrance page.

## Instructions

* This repository will build the necessary files to build a site which will enable a live view of our project.  The README file is an accounting of the progress for the project and GITHUB Pages will host our test site.

## Comments & Reflections  - 28 October

* **How did this go, overall:** 
Good start to have something commence as I begin this site on Katie's 30th birthday. 

* **What observations or questions do I need to answer or find answers for which I need the site to progress?**
 To get Rachel's buy-in is important as the genesis for this site and what it is to become is really due to her.  A couple of thoughts I need to begin brainstorming are:
 
 - How to produce random QRcodes and ensure they are maintained?
 - Where to host the site once we are out of testing and how the hosting can be paid for?
 - Where to allow Rachel to post her ideas in way that is easy for her so we can collaborate seemlessly?

* **Ideas To Remember**
The App
- Scan the QR Code
- Aura-like colors appear (of the creator’s choosing)
- The departed’s name will appear as if it’s being written (maybe in their handwriting?), then will disappear the same way it was written
- An image of the departed will appear as if forming from smoke or fading into full focus
- It will become slightly smaller and move slightly upwards as a banner appears beneath (banner, flower banner, greenery)
-T he full name will appear beneath the photo, then the birth/death dates and locations. 
- A playlist curated by the departed’s loved one begins to play

Scroll down -> Family Tree
- Background changes to a breezy, fall theme
- Family Tree has leaves flowing and falling off to represent the passage of time and changes to the tree. 
- Family Tree taking up the full screen. 
- At the very bottom is the departed, going up to photos of their parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. User can stop there or tap to extend further. User may select each photo and read first or full names of the departed’s ancestors, nothing more. 

Scroll down -> Photos of the departed
- Childhood photos/videos in chronological order if the creator so chooses. 

Scroll down -> Writings of the departed

Scroll down -> Testimonials from loved ones

Scroll down -> Option to leave virtual flowers or a kind word by users

Scroll down -> Charity donation/playlist information
